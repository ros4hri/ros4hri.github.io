**ROS for Human-Robot Interaction** (or ROS4HRI in short) is the main ROS API
for your robot to represent information about the human surrounding and
interacting with the robot.

*ROS4HRI* actually refers to a set of conventions and tools that help
developing Human-Robot Interaction capabilities. The specification
(originally developed by PAL Robotics) is available online as the `ROS
REP-155 <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0155.html>`__.
