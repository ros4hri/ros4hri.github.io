Welcome to ROS4HRI
==================

**ROS for Human-Robot Interaction** (or ROS4HRI in short) is the main ROS API
for your robot to represent information about the human surrounding and
interacting with the robot.

*ROS4HRI* includes both a :ref:`set of conventions and tools <standard>` that help
developing Human-Robot Interaction capabilities, and a large set of :ref:`ROS
packages <packages>` that implement these conventions.
