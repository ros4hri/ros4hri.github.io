Overview
--------

**Skills** are capabilities built into your robot. In practice, they are **regular ROS nodes**,
exposing **standard ROS interfaces** (actions, services or topics).

**What  make them special, however, is that they follow a well-defined
interface**, exposed in a manifest file: the **skill definition**. You can find here
the schema of a `valid skill definition <https://www.github.com/ros4hri/architecture_schemas/blob/main/schemas/skill.schema.json>`_.

.. important::
    To facilitate interoperability, **ROS4HRI provides definitions for a set of
    standard skills**, listed :ref:`below <list_of_skills>`. If you plan to implement one of these
    capabilities, please **ensure your implementation is compliant** with the
    corresponding skill definition.


Skills are organised in **domains**, as shown below:

Working with skills
-------------------

Implementing a skill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Skills are regular ROS nodes, exposing ROS interfaces (actions, services or topics).
To implement a skill, you need to:

1. Implement the ROS interfaces (actions, services or topics) of the skill (see the definitions below).
2. Implement the skill logic.
3. Declare that your package implements the skill by adding the following line in your ``package.xml`` file:
   
   .. code-block:: xml
      
      <export>
        <!-- .... -->

        <!-- adapt the following line to your skill -->
        <implements type="skill" package="communication_skills" id="ask" />
      </export>
   

You can use the :ref:`rpk <rpk>` tool to generate ROS4HRI-compliant skill skeletons.

Making an existing node compliant with ROS4HRI skills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since ROS4HRI skills are regular ROS nodes, you can make an existing node compliant with ROS4HRI skills by:

1. Adapting the ROS interfaces (actions, services or topics) of the existing node to the ROS interfaces of the skill (see the definitions below).
2. Declaring that your package implements the skill by adding the following line in your ``package.xml`` file:
   
   .. code-block:: xml
      
      <export>
        <!-- .... -->

        <!-- adapt the following line to your skill -->
        <implements type="skill" package="communication_skills" id="ask" />
      </export>
   
Sharing an open-source skill implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We would be happy to hear about your skill implementations!

As long as your skill is open-source, and publicly available on a forge like GitHub, GitLab, or Codeberg,
we will be happy to reference it in the ROS4HRI documentation.

Once your skill is available, `open a discussion on the ROS4HRI GitHub
organization <https://github.com/orgs/ros4hri/discussions/new?category=ideas>`_
to propose it for inclusion.

Note that we will need to review your skill implementation to ensure it is
compliant with ROS4HRI standards.


Creating a new skill and submitting it to ROS4HRI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to create a new skill and submit it to ROS4HRI, you need to:

1. Create a new skill definition.
2. Create a new ROS package implementing the skill.
3. Submit the skill to the right ROS4HRI repository.

Steps 1 and 2 can easily be done using the :ref:`rpk <rpk>` tool: it will
quickly generate a skeleton for your skill definition and skill implementation
based on ROS4HRI-compliant templates.

Step 3 can be done by submitting your skill to the right ROS4HRI repository.
Each domain has its own repository. Find below the domain that best matches your skill,
and submit your new skill proposal using the provided link.

Your proposal will be openly discussed by the ROS4HRI community, and if
accepted, your skill will be added to the corresponding ROS4HRI repository.

The main criteria for accepting a skill proposal are:

- The skill is novel and different from existing ones;
- The skill would be beneficial to a broad range of robots and applications;
- The skill is not tightly coupled to closed-source or proprietary technologies;
- The skill is well-documented.

Proposing a change/extension to a skill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to propose a change/extension to an existing skill, follow the link
in the corresponding section below.

Proposing a new domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To propose a new domain, please `open a discussion on the ROS4HRI GitHub
organization <https://github.com/orgs/ros4hri/discussions/new?category=ideas>`_.
