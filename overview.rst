===============================

Overview
--------

**ROS for Human-Robot Interaction** (or ROS4HRI in short) is an open-source
ROS standard and a set of ROS packages to facilitate the development of
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) capabilities on robots.

It includes:

#. a **core standard** (REP-155) defining conventions and topics for HRI,
#. **message definitions** to represent humans and HRI-related data,
#. **libraries** to facilitate the use of these messages in C++ and Python,
#. a set of **skills and actions definitions** for common HRI functionalities,
#. a set of **ROS packages** implementing perceptions and actions for HRI,
#. **tools** to generate ROS4HRI-compliant packages, simulate HRI scenarios, and visualize HRI data.
