==================

**ROS for Human-Robot Interaction** (or ROS4HRI [\[ros4hri\]](#ros4hri))
is the main ROS API for your robot to represent information
about the human surrounding and interacting with the robot.

*ROS4HRI* actually refers to a set of conventions and tools that help
developing Human-Robot Interaction capabilities. The specification
(originally developed by PAL Robotics) is available online as the [ROS
REP-155](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0155.html).
