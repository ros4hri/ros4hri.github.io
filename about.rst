**PAL Robotics** (who employs Séverin Lemaignan) has been a major contributor to
the development of the ROS4HRI standard and its implementation, using it as the
backbone for the HRI capabilities of their social robots (ARI, TIAGo).

Funding
-------

The development of ROS4HRI has been supported by several European research projects, including:

-   **SPRING** (https://spring-h2020.eu/): Socially Pertinent Robots in Gerontological Healthcare
-   **ARISE** (https://arise-middleware.eu/): Open-Source, real-time middleware for Industrial Human-Robot Interaction

We are grateful for their support in advancing open-source human-robot interaction.
